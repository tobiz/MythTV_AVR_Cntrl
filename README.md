# MythTV AVR Control Plugin
This is a MythTV-31 plugin for controlling a Marantz NR1604 AV Amp plus one of the attached, ceiling mounted, loadspeakers via a USB connected relay.
This started as a development of a similar program used to control a Marantz SR5002 and a version of MythTV around 2008; the Marantz failed and was too expensive to get it repaired.  It was decided to build a new, current MythTV, V31 and use it to control a Marantz NR1604 AV Amp (bought second hand).  At the start I thought this would be simpler than in 2008 since AVR H/W and MythTV would have moved on; error No 1! Controlling the Marantz proved much harder than the previous one.  Although now Marantz had LAN connected H/W and not RS232, driving the NR1604 proved a challenge since some of the commands could only be achieved, it seemed, via a Web Browser.  This was eventually solved after a number of google searches and some excellent tools developed primarily to testing web pages; the result is included here.  Although MythTV had made significant advances, in particular having introduced an architecture for custom 'plugins', and some excellent writeups on how to produce and build them (mythhello is noted inparticular) acheiving the GUI I required proved difficult.  I therefore decided to us Qt5 Designer as the base tool for developing the GUI. This would mean the result wouldn't fit into the excellent MythTV architecture, but would be good enough for me at this time.
